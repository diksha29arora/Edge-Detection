# Edge Detection
This program implements the Canny edge detection algorithm using OpenCV in python. You can use your own image as well as a realtime webcam video feed to detect edges.
edge.py is used to detect edges for a particular image (here, test.jpg).
realtime.py is used to detect the edges for realtime feed and show it on an OpenCV window.

(I implemented this program during the hands-on session on Computer Vision)
