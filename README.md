# Edge-Detection
This program is implementing the Canny edge detection algorithm using OpenCV in python. You can use your own image as well as a realtime webcam video feed to detect edges.

edge.py is used to detect edges for a perticulor image which is test.jpg in our case.
realtime.py is used to detect the edges for realtime feed and show it into a OpenCV window.

Happy Learning
